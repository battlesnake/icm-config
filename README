Title: 	icm-config

Description:
	Script to manage and allow easy selection of ICC/ICM color profiles in
	addition to automatically producing a startup script that can be used to
	apply the last chosen profiles on login.

Author:

Requires:
	dispwin, whiptail, cut, sed, bash 4+, grep,
	Color profiles [http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/icc_profiles.htm]

Installation:
	Symlink or copy the <icm-config> script to /usr/bin

Usage:
	Color profiles are arranged as follows:
		/usr/share/icm/<index> <screen name>/<profile>

	The <index> is the dispwin index of the screen <screen name>, which may
	be obtained via `dispwin -h`.  The <screen name> is also shown here,
	although any name can be used (e.g. "left screen", "right screen").
	The script uses the <screen name> and <profile> to build user-friendly
	menus to allow assignment of profiles to screens.

	The <screen name> may contain spaces, however the profile name MUST NOT
	contain anything that would need quoting or escaping.

	For example, `ls -d1 /usr/share/icm/*/` on my system results in:
		/usr/share/icm/1 Dell U2412M/
		/usr/share/icm/2 Dell U2312HM/

	And `ls -1 "/usr/share/icm/1 Dell U2412M/"` on my system produces:
		AdobeRGB1998.icc
		dell_u2412m_standard.icc
		dell_u2412m_calibrated.icc
		sRGB Color Space Profile.icm

	The .icc/.icm extensions are optional, the script uses a * wildcard to
	list profiles.

	The names of the selected profiles and the corresponding monitor
	indices are stored to ~/.icm-config/selected, which is executable via
	the icm-config script.  To have your last selections automatically
	applied at login, simply add this script to your list of on-login
	commands.

	Syntax for the script:
		icm-config [{ "auto" | <file> }]

	With no parameters, icm-config brings up a nice whiptail menu to allow
	selection of monitors and color profiles.  With "auto" as the only
	parameter, icm-config will re-apply the last selections, which are read
	from ~/.icm-config/selected.  To have icm-config apply selections from
	some other file, specify that file as the only parameter to icm-config,
	for example if I have 3 sets of selections named <calibrated>, <gaming>
	and <films>:
		# Run on login, to set some calibrated profiles
		icm-config ~/.icm-config/calibrated
		# Run before starting games for a saturated, brighter profile
		icm-config ~/.icm-config/gaming
		# Run before playing films for a cooler, darker profile
		icm-config ~/.icm-config/films

	The syntax of extra selection files mirrors the syntax of the default
	selections file.
